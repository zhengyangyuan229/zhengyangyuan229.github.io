# Zhengyang Yuan

PhD student at the **University of Edinburgh** (Biomedical Sciences).  
I work on **neuroendocrinology** and **pituitary corticotroph signalling**, focusing on how cells decode input patterns (frequency, amplitude, duration) using calcium imaging and downstream readouts (e.g., pCREB).

---

## Research focus
- **Frequency encoding** in corticotroph cells (CRH/AVP inputs)
- **Calcium imaging analysis** (signal processing, peak features, AUC, baseline correction)
- **Image segmentation & quantification** (Cellpose/Imaris, QC metrics)

---

## Current work
- Tissue slice experiments with patterned stimulation (CRH/AVP, KCl)
- Automated pipelines for segmentation + single-cell quantification
- Experimental plans for secretion assays (ACTH) alongside imaging readouts

---

## Tools & skills
**Analysis:** Python, R, Jupyter, ggplot2  
**Imaging:** Fiji/ImageJ, Cellpose, Imaris  
**Methods:** confocal/TIRF workflows, quantification, reproducible version control (Git/GitHub)

---

## Teaching & tutoring
Teaching assistant for **IBI1** (University of Edinburgh).  
I support practical sessions on Git/GitHub, basic coding workflows, and reproducible research.
